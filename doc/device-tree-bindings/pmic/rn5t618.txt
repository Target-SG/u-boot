Ricoh RN5T618 PMIC

This file describes the binding info for the PMIC driver.

Required properties:
- compatible: "ricoh,rn5t618"
- reg: depending on strapping, e.g. 0x32

With those two properties, the PMIC device can be used to read/write
registers.

Example:

rn5t618@32 {
	compatible = "ricoh,rn5t618";
	reg = <0x32>;
};
